# Workshop Week2

## Task1
Write a program that generates and prints some random numbers using the â€˜random.random()â€™ command. What values are generated by this command?

Code
```py
import random

ranNum = random.random()
print(ranNum)
```
Output
```
0.8451377878081776
```

## Task2
Write a program that simulates an unbiased coin flip. Your program should print true if the coin flip results in a head and false if the coin flip results in a tail.
> Hint: any value greater than 0.5, represents Head otherwise it represents Tail

Code
```py
import random

flip = random.random()
print(flip)
if flip > 0.5:
    print('True')
else:
    print('False')
```
Output
```
0.7640486090089101
Head
```

## Task3
Now consider a biased coin. Write a program that takes a value p , with range between 0 and 1, as input from the user and then get a random number between 0 and 1 which simulate the coin flip similar to the previous program.   
If value p is greater than generated random number, print head otherwise print Tail. 

Code
```py
import random

p = float(input('Enter probability of the flip : '))
flip = random.random()
print(flip)

if p >= flip:
    print('Head')
else:
    print('Tail')
```
Output
```
Enter probability of the flip : 0.6
0.47493865204189134
Head
```

## Task4
Make an annoying number guessing game.
> Hint: you may generate the target value using a random number. In this case, the target value is just. 

Code
```py
import random
ranNum = random.randint(1, 100)

num = int(input('Enter the number: '))

if num > ranNum:
    print('too big')
elif num < ranNum:
    print('too small')
else:
    print('correct')
```
Output
```
Enter the number: 45
too small
```

## Task5
Write a program to get a student mark, as an input from user and print its grade based on the following criteria:

- if mark>=80 print 'A'
- if mark between 70-80 print 'B'
- if mark between 60-70 print 'C'
- if mark between 50-60 print 'D'
- if mark < 50 print 'F'

Code
```py
grade = int(input('Enter your grade: '))
if grade < 0 or grade > 100:
    print('invalid output')
elif grade >= 80:
    print('A')
elif 70 <= grade < 80:
    print('B')
elif 60 <= grade < 70:
    print('C')
elif 50 <= grade < 60:
    print('D')
else:
    print('F')
```
Output
```
Enter the number: 45
too small
```

## Task6
Write a program to get an integer number from user, the number must be an even number between 10 and 50. Your program should generate another random number between 10 to 100, which is divisible by 7. Display the generated number. Then If the first number is greater or equivalent than the generated random number, add them and display the result, otherwise get them multiplied and display the output.
> Hint: you must use only random.randint(), do NOT use randrange for this exercise.

Code
```py
num1 = int(input('Enter an even number between 10 to 50: '))

if num < 10 or num > 50:
    print('invalid output')
else:
    ranNum = random.randint(10, 100)
    print(ranNum)
    
    result = 0
    if ranNum % 7 == 0 and num1 >= ranNum:
        result = num1 + ranNum
        print("The sum of the number you have entered, %d and the generated number, %d is: %d" % (num, ranNum, result))
    else:
        result = num1 * ranNum
        print("The product of the number you have entered, %d and the generated number, %d is: %d" % (num, ranNum, result))
```
Output
```
Enter an even number between 10 to 50: 43
42
The sum of the number you have entered, 45 and the generated number, 42 is: 85
```
